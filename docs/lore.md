# Welcome to Crypto Rome

The Crypto Roman world is one of excess and advanced technology.
The lack of consequence has shaped the economy in unusual ways.
While many live out their fantasies, there is turmoil lurking
beneath the surface.

Nearly a millennium ago, the crypto roman bio-consensarri found a
vein of SKALE in the arctic region. This SKALE bubbles to the
surface and, in this cold, desolate place, the wootgump plant
thrives. These magical plants, in turn, allow a jungle to flourish
in the bitter cold. The wootgump plant is filled with
psycho-active nanoparticles that heal everything around them, even
death.

With this new power to heal, the economy shifted to pure
entertainment. Bloodsport became the dominant way to earn
prestige. The Colosseum quickly dominated the social structure of
Crypto Rome.

Now, Crypto Colosseum: Larva Maiorum is the dance between
gladiators, patrons, and the crowd. The action-packed battles
happen at the speed of adrenaline and the screams of the
bloodthirsty fans.

Crypto Colosseum: Larva Maiorum is a massively multiplayer
real-time battle strategy game. The crowd changes the outcome of
every battle through strategic item play, cheering, and trash
talk.
